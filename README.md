# Training Accuracies

<img src = "results/exp_10.png" >
Loss and accuracy with full model containing 4 convolution layers. It has a learning rate of 0.0001 and zero momentum. Model tends to learn fast with less convolution layers. Model gives a best accuracy of 44%.


<img src = "results/exp_50.png" >
Loss and accuracy with full model containing 6 convolution layers. It has a learning rate of 0.001 and 0.9 momentum. Model gives a best accuracy of 42%.


<img src = "results/exp_300.png" >
Loss and accuracy with full model containing 4 convolution layers. It has a learning rate of 0.0001 and zero momentum. Model tends to learn fast with less convolution layers. Model gives a best accuracy of 44%.

# Validation Accuracy
